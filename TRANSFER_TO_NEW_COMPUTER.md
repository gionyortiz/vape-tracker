## Quick upload steps (Windows PowerShell)
Open PowerShell and run these from the project folder. This assumes your repo remote `origin` is already configured and branch is `main` (adjust if different).

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\giony\Desktop\vape-tracker\vape-tracker1.3"
git status
# Add specific modified files plus any other needed files
git add manifest.json sw.js index.html images/icon* images/screenshots/* images/shortcuts/* store-assets/android/play-store-listing.txt
# or add everything if you're sure
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix all PWA issues - ready for perfect app generation"
git push origin main
```

Notes:
- Wait ~2–3 minutes for GitHub Pages to reflect changes at `https://gionyortiz.github.io/vape-tracker`.
- If your default branch is `master` or another name, replace `main` in `git push`.

---

## Local smoke test before packaging
Install dev dependency and run a static server to confirm the site and service worker behave locally.

```powershell
npm install
npx http-server -p 8080
# Open: http://localhost:8080 in browser, check console for errors, verify installability (Add to home screen), offline behavior.
```

Checkpoints:
- Confirm service worker registers and caches assets (open DevTools > Application > Service Workers)
- Verify manifest icons and shortcuts show correctly (inspect `manifest.json` URL in browser)
- Test offline pages and basic flows (Inventory, Sales, Dashboard)

---

## PWABuilder packaging (manual steps)
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com
2. Enter: `https://gionyortiz.github.io/vape-tracker` and click Start
3. Click "Package For Stores" and choose Android
4. Download the AAB (or APK if needed) and keep it for Play Console upload

Notes:
- PWABuilder will analyze manifest and service worker. If it flags missing icons/screenshots, ensure `manifest.json` references the files you uploaded.
- For Google Play make sure the app ID `com.nexaquantum.elduro.vaper.pos` matches the package id used by the build.

---

## Google Play Console - submission checklist
- Create or sign in to Google Play Console (one-time $25 fee)
- Create a new app and fill out:
  - App name: NexaQuantum El Duro Vaper POS
  - Category: Business
  - Age rating: 17+ (tobacco content)
  - Privacy policy and support email (support@nexaquantum.com)
- Upload the AAB from PWABuilder
- Use `store-assets/android/play-store-listing.txt` for the store listing text and screenshots from `images/screenshots/`
- Set Pricing & Distribution and subscriptions (monthly/yearly/enterprise) as configured

---

## iOS / App Store & Microsoft Store notes
- iOS: PWABuilder can produce an iOS wrapper, but final App Store submission requires a macOS machine with Xcode and an Apple Developer account ($99/yr).
- Microsoft Store: PWABuilder provides packaging options for Windows; submit via Microsoft Partner Center.

If you want, I can also:
- Create a single PowerShell script to automate the `git add/commit/push` steps.
- Run a local smoke test and capture console logs (I can provide the exact commands).
- Generate a checklist file in the repo root (this file is that checklist).

Reply with which automation you'd like and I will prepare it.
