## 🎯 What Happens Automatically

Once you enable GitHub Pages:

1. ✅ **Workflow triggers** - Every time you push to `main` branch
2. ✅ **Builds your app** - Uses the workflow we created
3. ✅ **Deploys to GitHub Pages** - Makes it publicly accessible
4. ✅ **HTTPS enabled** - Automatic SSL certificate
5. ✅ **PWA works** - Service worker, offline mode, installable
6. ✅ **Updates automatically** - Any new commits = auto-deploy

## 📱 Testing Your Deployed App

Once live, test these:

### **Desktop Browser:**
```
1. Open: https://gionyortiz.github.io/vape-tracker/
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Check Console - should be no errors
4. Check Application tab - PWA should be installable
```

### **Mobile Device:**
```
1. Open URL on phone
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. Install it - works like native app!
4. Test offline mode - disconnect internet, still works
```

### **PWA Installation:**
```

iOS Safari: Share → Add to Home Screen
Android Chrome: "Install App" banner appears
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue 1: "Deploy from a branch" is selected**
**Fix:** Change Source to "GitHub Actions"

### **Issue 2: Workflow fails**

## 🎨 Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

Want to use **nexaquantumvape.com** instead of GitHub URL?

### **Steps:**

1. **Add CNAME file to repository:**
   ```
   echo "nexaquantumvape.com" > CNAME
   git add CNAME
   git commit -m "Add custom domain"
   git push
   ```

2. **Configure Cloudflare DNS:**
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: @ (or www)
   Target: gionyortiz.github.io
   Proxy: ON (orange cloud)
   ```

3. **Enable in GitHub:**
   - Settings → Pages
   - Custom domain: nexaquantumvape.com
   - Save
   - Wait for DNS check (checkmark appears)

4. **Enable HTTPS:**
