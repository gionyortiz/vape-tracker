## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Certificate Storage
- ‚úÖ Store certificates in secure, backed-up location
- ‚úÖ Use strong passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- ‚úÖ Document all certificate information
- ‚úÖ Set calendar reminders for certificate renewal
- ‚ùå Never share certificates or passwords
- ‚ùå Don't store credentials in code repositories

### iOS Certificate Management
- Distribution certificates expire after 1 year
- Provisioning profiles expire after 1 year
- Set reminders 30 days before expiration
- Always create backup certificates

### Android Keystore Management
- Keystore files never expire (if validity period is long enough)
- **CRITICAL**: Never lose keystore file - you cannot update your app without it
- Create multiple backup copies stored securely
- Document all passwords in secure password manager
