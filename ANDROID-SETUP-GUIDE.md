# ðŸ¤– Android Deployment - Complete Step-by-Step Guide

## Current Status
Your app is built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and is PWA-ready. You have TWO paths to Google Play Store:

---

## ðŸŒŸ **RECOMMENDED: Path 1 - PWA via Trusted Web Activity (TWA)**

**Why this is better:**
- âœ… No complex native build setup needed
- âœ… Faster deployment (hours vs days)
- âœ… Easier updates (just update your website)
- âœ… Google officially recommends this for web apps
- âœ… Your app already has everything needed (manifest.json, service worker)

### Prerequisites:
1. **Host your app online** (Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel)
2. **HTTPS domain** (required for PWA)
3. **Google Play Console account** ($25 one-time fee)

### Steps:

#### **Step 1: Deploy Your PWA Online**

**Option A: GitHub Pages (Free, Easiest)**
```powershell
# Your repo is already set up! Just enable GitHub Pages:
# 1. Go to: https://github.com/gionyortiz/vape-tracker/settings/pages
# 2. Source: Deploy from branch "main"
# 3. Folder: / (root)
# 4. Save
# Your app will be at: https://gionyortiz.github.io/vape-tracker/
```

**Option B: Netlify (Free, Professional)**
```powershell
# 1. Go to https://www.netlify.com/
# 2. Sign up with GitHub
# 3. "New site from Git" â†’ Select your repo
# 4. Build settings:
#    - Base directory: (leave empty)
#    - Build command: (leave empty - it's already built)
#    - Publish directory: /
# 5. Deploy!
# You'll get a URL like: https://nexaquantum-pos.netlify.app
```

#### **Step 2: Generate Android App Bundle**

#    - Launch URL: (your deployed URL)
#    - Icon: (upload images/icon-512.png)
# 7. Click "Generate" â†’ Download the .aab file
```

**Method B: Use Bubblewrap CLI (More Control)**
```powershell
# Install Bubblewrap

# Follow the prompts:
# - Application ID: com.nexaquantum.vape.pos

## ðŸ”§ **Path 2 - Traditional Cordova Native Build**

**Use this if you need:**
- Full native device access
- Custom native plugins
- More control over build process

### Prerequisites to Install:

**1. Java Development Kit (JDK)**
```powershell
# Download JDK 11 from:
# https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
# Install and set JAVA_HOME environment variable
```

**2. Android Studio**
```powershell
# Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
# Install Android SDK Command-line Tools
# Install Android SDK Platform 33 (Android 13)
# Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
```

**3. Gradle** (Usually comes with Android Studio)

### Build Steps:

```powershell
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd d:\APP\vape-tracker1.3

# 2. Add Android platform
cordova platform add android

# 3. Install all required plugins (automated in build script)
# See build-android.bat for complete plugin list

# 4. Build release version
cordova build android --release

# 5. Sign the APK (required for Play Store)
# The build-android.bat script handles this automatically
# Or run: .\build-android.bat

# Output will be in:
# platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
# or
# platforms/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### Signing Configuration:

The app needs to be signed with a keystore. Your `build-android.bat` script auto-generates one, but for production:

```powershell
# Generate production keystore (do this ONCE and keep it safe!)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore nexaquantum-release-key.keystore -alias nexaquantum -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Enter strong passwords and company details when prompted
# BACKUP THIS FILE - You cannot update your app without it!
```

## ðŸ†˜ **Troubleshooting**

### "PWA score is low"
- Make sure your manifest.json is valid
- Ensure service worker is registered
- Test on HTTPS (localhost or deployed)

### "App bundle failed to upload"
- Check package name matches everywhere
- Ensure .aab file is signed
- Try uploading as APK first for testing

### "Missing required screenshots"
- Use Chrome DevTools device emulation
- Take screenshots at required sizes
- Include at least 2 different screens
