    <section>
      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>NexaQuantum LLC ("we", "our", "us") provides the NexaQuantum El Duro Vaper POS application (the "App"). The App is a standalone point‑of‑sale solution that runs entirely on your device as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and, optionally, as a Cordova mobile app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What data the App handles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Business data you enter</strong> such as products, inventory, transactions, employees, and customers. This information is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using browser storage (localStorage/IndexedDB).</li>
        <li><strong>Optional customer information</strong> (name, email, phone) when you choose to record it for receipts or loyalty. You control whether this data is entered.</li>
        <li><strong>License and payment metadata</strong> only when you choose to purchase a license or subscription. These purchases are processed by app‑store billing or the configured payment provider. We do not store full payment card data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The App does <strong>not</strong> send your POS data to our servers by default. There is no cloud backend in this repository. Any synchronization or export you perform is initiated by you.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How data is used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate core POS features (inventory, sales, reporting).</li>
        <li>Provide licensing/entitlement checks when purchasing a subscription.</li>
        <li>Generate receipts/exports that you explicitly trigger.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data storage and retention</h2>
      <p>All POS data is stored locally on your device/browser. You can clear, back up, or export this data from the App’s Data Manager. Uninstalling the App or clearing browser storage may remove your local data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
      <p>If you use in‑app purchases or platform billing, your purchase is processed by the relevant store (e.g., Microsoft Store, Google Play, Apple App Store). Those platforms handle your payment details under their own policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is intended for business use by adults and is not directed to children.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your choices and controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Export or delete your data using the in‑app Data Manager tools.</li>
        <li>Revoke camera or file access permissions via your device/browser settings.</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App at any time.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
